=== Pre-requisites

Install
https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator[github-changelog-generator]
globally in your dev box:

....
gem install github_changelog_generator
....

=== Update the changelog and create a new tag

The automatic changelog generation leverages GitHub labels very heavily
to produce a meaningful output following the
https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/[Keep a Changelog] specification,
grouping pull requests and issues in sections.

Use the labels as follows: - `+enhancement+` or `+addition+` items go in
the `+Added+` section; - `+bug+` or `+fix+` items go in the `+Fixed+`
section; - `+removal+` items go in the `+Removed+` section; - unlabelled
pull requests go in the `+Other Changes+` section; - unlabelled closed
issues are ignored.

You donâ€™t have to label everything: the intent of the changelog is to
communicate highlights to end-users, while also being comprehensive;
this is why the `+Other changes+` section catches all the unlabelled
items and is rendered last.

Once you do a quick round of issues/PR triaging to apply labels in a
meaningful way, follow these steps:

[source,bash]
----
# always create a dedicated release branch
git switch -c release-x.y.z

# x1.y1.z1 is the previous release tag
github_changelog_generator --since-tag=x1.y1.z1 --future-release=x.y.z

git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "add x.y.z changelog entry"

# maybe make some other last minute changes
# [...]

# merge and tag, making sure the tag is on the merge commit
git switch main
git merge --no-ff release-x.y.z
git tag x.y.z

# don't forget to force update the rolling tag!
git fetch --tags -f

# push directly
git push --tags origin main
----

Optionally, open a pull request from the release branch instead of
tagging and pushing manually.

=== GitHub release

____
Note: this step will soon be automated.
____

Go to the https://github.com/trento-project/agent/releases[project
releases page] and create a new release, then:

* use the just created git tag as the release tag and title;
* copy-paste the last changelog entry from `+CHANGELOG.md+` as the
release body;
* hit the green button;
* profit!
